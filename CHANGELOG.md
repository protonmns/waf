## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **FR-014 XSS enhance** — iterative JSON walker (hard depth cap 64 so the
  engine cannot stack-overflow on malicious nesting), form-urlencoded
  scanner, Content-Type-aware dispatch. `text/markdown` body-skip mitigates
  false positives on code-block snippets.
- **FR-015 path traversal enhance** — adopts shared `request_targets()` so
  recursive-decoded variants are covered (`%252e%252e` no longer slips
  past); new anchored patterns for `/etc/<sensitive>`, `/proc/<pid>/…`,
  `\windows\system32`, `boot.ini` / `win.ini`.
- **FR-016 SSRF detection (NEW)** — RFC1918 / loopback / link-local / cloud
  metadata (AWS `169.254.169.254`, GCP, Alibaba `100.100.100.200`, Consul);
  obfuscated IPs (hex, octal, decimal dword, IPv6-mapped). Userinfo bypass
  `http://google.com@169.254.169.254/` resolves to the metadata IP via
  `url::Url::host()`. Opt-in allowlist via
  `defense_config.ssrf_outbound_host_allowlist`.
- **FR-017 header injection (NEW)** — raw + `%0d%0a` / `%250d%250a` CRLF in
  header values and names; `Host` header whitelist (`host_inbound_whitelist`)
  with IPv6-bracket awareness; `X-Forwarded-For` leftmost-private + max-hops.
- **FR-018 brute force + credential stuffing (NEW)** — consumes the
  `Check::on_response` default hook. BF-001: `(user_hash, ip)` failure
  counter ≥ `bf_max_per_user`. BF-002: password sprayed against ≥
  `bf_spray_threshold` distinct users from same IP. Status-code-only v1
  (401/403); body-regex deferred. SHA-256-truncated usernames/passwords —
  never plaintext in state.
- **FR-019 scanner recon enhance** — per-IP sliding-window state with
  endpoint enumeration (distinct-path threshold) and OPTIONS preflight
  abuse. Bounded at `scanner_max_ips` (default 100k) with oldest-10%
  eviction against IPv6-rotating OOM vector.
- **FR-020 request body abuse (NEW)** — declared `Content-Length` size
  gate (64 KiB to match gateway `BODY_PREVIEW_LIMIT`), magic-byte
  Content-Type mismatch (JSON/XML/HTML/ZIP/GZIP), iterative byte-scan JSON
  depth pre-check (bails before any parser allocation), key-count explosion
  via iterative `Value` walker.
- **Detection framework** — `Phase` enum gets 4 new variants (`Ssrf`,
  `HeaderInjection`, `BruteForce`, `RequestBodyAbuse`). `Check` trait
  extended with default-impl `on_response(&self, _ctx, _status)` hook.
  `WafEngine::on_response(ctx, status)` dispatcher for gateway wiring.
  `Clock` trait + `SystemClock` + `MockClock` test fixture so stateful
  checks advance time deterministically without sleeping.
- **Coverage infra** — `Dockerfile.coverage` (rust:1.91 + `cargo-llvm-cov`
  0.8.5 pinned), `scripts/coverage-gate.sh` + smoke fixtures,
  `scripts/create-worktrees.sh` + `setup-worktree-env.sh`, CI `coverage`
  job (informational — gate flips to enforcing after the waf-engine
  baseline-raise follow-up lands).

- **FR-008 access lists** — Phase-0 gate ahead of the 16-phase rule pipeline:
  per-tier IP whitelist (Patricia trie via `ip_network_table`), IP blacklist,
  and per-tier Host (FQDN) whitelist. Runs Host gate → IP blacklist →
  IP whitelist with deny-wins-over-allow semantics; per-tier `whitelist_mode`
  dispatches between `full_bypass` (skip all later phases) and `blacklist_only`
  (defense-in-depth, default). Configuration in `rules/access-lists.yaml`,
  hot-reloaded via `notify` + `ArcSwap` with ~250 ms debounce; bad YAML keeps
  the previous snapshot live with a `tracing::warn!`. Audit fields
  `access_decision` / `access_reason` / `access_match` stamp every request.
  Operator guide: [`docs/access-lists.md`](docs/access-lists.md).
  Tor exit list, bad-ASN classification, and validated XFF `ctx.client_ip`
  are deferred to FR-042 and FR-007.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-27

### Security

- Eliminate 8 `panic!` calls in LazyLock regex initializers — replaced with
  `tracing::error!` + safe degradation (`RegexSet::empty()`) so a malformed
  compiled-in pattern never crashes the process.
- Add SSRF protection for Webhook and CrowdSec URLs with dual-mode validation
  (`url_validator.rs`): `validate_public_url()` resolves DNS and rejects RFC-1918
  / loopback / link-local / multicast addresses; `validate_scheme_only()` for
  contexts where DNS resolution is not yet available.
- Implement DNS rebinding guard using `resolve_to_addrs()` IP pinning — the
  resolved address set is cached and re-validated on each outbound connection to
  defeat time-of-check / time-of-use DNS rebinding attacks.
- Add iterative URL decoding (`url_decode_recursive`) to prevent double / triple
  encoding bypass of WAF rules (e.g., `%2527` → `%27` → `'`).
- Harden remote rule fetching: redirect following disabled, 30 s connect/read
  timeout enforced, response body capped at 10 MB.
- Add Admin API security middleware: IP allowlist enforcement, per-IP rate
  limiting, and strict security response headers (`X-Frame-Options`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy`).
- Add login rate limiting (per-IP, configurable) and WebSocket upgrade IP
  allowlist to the Admin UI server.
- Fix cluster peer registration fencing: stale peer records are evicted before a
  new node with the same ID is accepted, preventing split-brain from rapid
  restart cycles.
- Fix XFF trusted-proxy CIDR validation: malformed CIDR strings in
  `trusted_proxies` now produce a config error at startup instead of a runtime
  panic.
- Fix rule deletion memory sync: rule removal now performs an atomic swap of the
  in-memory `RuleRegistry` so in-flight requests never observe a partially
  updated rule set.

### Added

- `detect_sqli` and `detect_xss` operators via the `libinjectionrs` pure-Rust
  crate — OWASP CRS core rules `CRS-942100` (SQL injection) and `CRS-941100`
  (XSS) are now fully evaluated at runtime instead of being silently skipped.
- Async `load_remote_sources()` method on `RuleRegistry` / `RemoteUrl` rule
  sources: remote rule sets are fetched in the background after startup so cold
  boot latency is unaffected.
- `url_validator` module (`waf-engine/src/security/url_validator.rs`) exposing
  `validate_public_url()` and `validate_scheme_only()`.
- `.cargo/audit.toml` policy file that suppresses known upstream transitive
  dependency advisories originating from the Pingora crate family (documented
  with justification comments).
- 116 new regression tests (suite total: 243) covering SSRF validation, encoding
  bypass, SQLi/XSS detection, cluster fencing, and dependency-upgrade
  compatibility.

### Changed

#### Dependency Upgrades

- **wasmtime**: 23.0.3 → 43.0.0 — resolves 5 published CVEs in the WASM
  runtime.
- **axum**: 0.7 → 0.8.8; **axum-extra**: 0.9 → 0.12 — aligns with the current
  stable axum ecosystem.
- **tower**: 0.4 → 0.5.3; **tower-http**: 0.5 → 0.6.8.
- **jsonwebtoken**: 9 → 10, switching to the `rust_crypto` backend to remove
  the OpenSSL dependency from the JWT path.
- **reqwest**: 0.12 → 0.13.
- **tokio-tungstenite**: 0.23 → 0.26.
- **toml**: 0.8 → 1.1.
- **serde_yaml**: deprecated 0.9 → **serde_yaml_ng** 0.10.
- **rustls-pemfile**: unmaintained crate replaced with the built-in PEM parser
  from **rustls-pki-types**.
- **sqlx**: set `default-features = false` to drop the unused `rsa` transitive
  dependency from the build graph.

### Fixed

- Remote URL rule sources were silently skipped in `load_all()` due to a missing
  async dispatch path — they are now loaded via `load_remote_sources()` after
  startup and on each scheduled refresh.
- OWASP CRS rules that use the `detect_sqli` / `detect_xss` operators were
  silently skipped because the operator was unregistered — the `libinjectionrs`
  integration now registers both operators at engine initialisation.
- Dead peer automatic eviction in cluster mode: peers that fail the phi-accrual
  threshold and do not reconnect within the configured grace period are now
  removed from the peer table and from the Admin UI node list.

## [0.1.0-rc.1] — 2026-03-16

### Added

#### Cluster — Full QUIC mTLS mesh (P1–P5 complete)

- **waf-cluster crate**: New crate implementing the full cluster protocol.

- **P1 — Transport & Certificates**
  - QUIC mTLS server/client (`transport/server.rs`, `transport/client.rs`) using
    quinn 0.11 + rustls 0.23 + rcgen 0.13 — reusing patterns from `gateway/http3.rs`.
  - Ed25519 cluster CA generation via `rcgen` (`crypto/ca.rs`).
  - Per-node certificate signing (`crypto/node_cert.rs`).
  - AES-GCM CA key storage for encrypted replication to workers (`crypto/store.rs`).
  - HMAC-SHA256 join token generation and validation (`crypto/token.rs`).
  - Length-prefixed JSON frame codec over QUIC streams (`transport/frame.rs`).
  - Static seed discovery from `ClusterConfig.seeds` (`discovery.rs`).
  - Heartbeat sender (periodic) and heartbeat tracker per peer (`health/`).

- **P2 — Rule & Config Sync**
  - `RuleChangelog` ring buffer (500-entry VecDeque) on main for incremental sync.
  - Full rule snapshot: serialize `RuleRegistry` → lz4-compressed JSON.
  - Incremental sync: workers send `RuleSyncRequest { current_version }` and receive
    only changed entries since their last known version.
  - Config sync protocol (TOML string) over a dedicated stream.
  - Attack event batching on workers with periodic flush to main.
  - `StorageMode` enum: `Full` (DB available) / `ForwardOnly` (writes forwarded).
  - `PendingForwards` for in-flight API write forwarding from workers to main.

- **P3 — Raft-lite Election & Failover**
  - `ElectionManager`: in-memory Raft-lite state machine (term, vote, timeout).
  - Phi-accrual failure detector (Cassandra-style) per-peer (`health/detector.rs`).
  - Role transitions: `Worker → Candidate → Main` and `Main → Worker`.
  - Split-brain prevention: fencing tokens + quorum requirement (N/2+1 votes).
  - CA key replication: encrypted CA key distributed to workers in `JoinResponse`.
  - CLI subcommands: `status`, `nodes`, `token generate`, `promote`, `demote`, `remove`.
  - 20 cluster tests across election, heartbeat, mTLS, and sync scenarios.

- **P4 — Admin UI Cluster Panel**
  - REST API under `/api/cluster/*` (5 endpoints: status, nodes, node detail,
    token generate, node remove).
  - `AppState.cluster_state: Option<Arc<NodeState>>` (None = standalone mode).
  - Four Vue 3 + Tailwind cluster views: Overview, Node Detail, Tokens, Sync Status.
  - i18n keys for English, Chinese, Russian, and Georgian.

- **P5 — Integration Test & Docker (this release)**
  - `docker-compose.cluster.yml`: 3-node cluster (1 main + 2 workers) using
    the existing `Dockerfile.prebuilt` pattern. Nodes communicate on port 16851
    via an internal `cluster_net` Docker network.
  - `tests/e2e-cluster.sh`: end-to-end test script verifying:
    - All 3 nodes healthy
    - Rule created on main syncs to workers within 15s
    - Election completes after stopping the main (new main elected)
    - Node rejoin after restart
  - `configs/cluster-node-{a,b,c}.toml`: per-node configuration files for the
    3-node docker-compose setup.
  - `docs/cluster-guide.md`: quick-start guide, full configuration reference,
    certificate management, troubleshooting, and architecture notes.
  - `cluster cert-init` CLI command: generates cluster CA + per-node certs
    offline for pre-provisioned deployments (`prx-waf cluster cert-init --nodes
    node-a,node-b,node-c --output-dir /certs`).
  - `ClusterCryptoConfig.ca_key` field: path to the CA private key file (main
    node only; empty on workers).
  - `CertificateAuthority::from_cert_pem()`: load CA cert without private key
    (used by worker nodes that only need to verify peer certs, not sign new ones).
  - Hostname resolution for cluster seeds: seeds can now be specified as
    `hostname:port` (e.g., `"node-a:16851"`) instead of requiring IP addresses —
    critical for docker-compose DNS names.
  - `auto_generate = false` path in `ClusterNode::run()`: loads certificates from
    files instead of always generating ephemeral in-memory certs.

### Changed

- `waf-common::config::ClusterCryptoConfig`: added `ca_key` field (empty default —
  fully backward-compatible with existing configs).
- `waf-cluster::crypto::ca::CertificateAuthority::as_rcgen_issuer()`: now returns
  an error if called on a cert-only instance (constructed via `from_cert_pem`).
- `waf-cluster::ClusterNode::run()`: restructured to support both in-memory cert
  generation (`auto_generate = true`) and file-based loading (`auto_generate = false`).
  NodeState is now created before cert setup to resolve `node_id` first.
- Cluster seed parsing: migrated from `str::parse::<SocketAddr>()` to
  `tokio::net::lookup_host()` for DNS/hostname support.

### Architecture Notes

- All cluster inter-node traffic runs over QUIC (UDP port 16851) with mutual TLS.
- Workers maintain an in-memory `RuleRegistry` populated via cluster sync.
  No SQLite required — workers operate database-free if needed.
- The entire cluster feature adds exactly **one new workspace dependency**: `lz4_flex`
  (all other deps — quinn, rustls, rcgen — were already in the workspace).
- WASM plugins are not synced to worker nodes in v1 (documented limitation).
- Standalone mode (no `[cluster]` section) continues to work with zero behavior change.
